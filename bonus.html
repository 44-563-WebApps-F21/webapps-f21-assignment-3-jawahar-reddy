        <h1 style="color:#00ccff;"> Nebula</h1>
        <p style="color:#00ccff;">Nebula, a ruthless space pirate, was taught by her adopted father, the cosmic tyrant Thanos, to win at all costs. Unlike her redeemed foster sister Gamora, Nebula is simply interested in power, and she will team up with any villain who will help her carry out her plans. Nebula has often positioned herself as a thorn in the side of her most recurring foes, the eclectic Guardians of the Galaxy. 
            Having been rendered comatose by the revisitation of her traumatic past, Nebula had underwent deep seated neruobiological reconstructive surgery at the hand of Dr. Mandibus. These bionic upgrades give her incredible physical as well as technical supplementary enhancements beyond what she was capable of before</p>
