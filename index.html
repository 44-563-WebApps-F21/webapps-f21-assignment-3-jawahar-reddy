            <h2>Code Display of oriented area of a triangle</h2>
            <blockquote> There are formulas for the area of a triangle in terms of the vertices' coordinates that produce the algebraic area automatically. For example, we may use the formula (1/2)(ad - bc) to get the algebraic area of a triangle with the first vertex at (0, 0), the second vertex at (a, b), and the third vertex at (c, d). 
              Because d/c > b/a implies that ad > bc and ad - bc > 0, this will be positive if the slope d/c of the line from (0, 0) through (c, d) is greater than the slope b/a of the line from (0, 0) through (a, b). If the line along (a, b) turns counterclockwise to reach the line along (c, d), the triangle from (0, 0) to (a, b) to (c, d) has positive area. , and if it rotates in a clockwise direction, the algebraic area of the triangle is negative</blockquote>
