            Thor is a God from a world called Asgard who is an Avenger with a tag called God of thunder, lightning, storms and strength. He is the heir to the throne of Asgard, held by his father Odin, and a very powerful warrior. He was given a powerful hammer, called Mjolnir, 
            which allowed him to control storms, blast people with energy, fly, open portals to other dimensions, time travel, transform his appearance, and even kill immortals.<br> Thor made a name for himself as the mightiest warrior on his homeworld and subsequently became well known for his actions on Earth.
